# EduSched: AI-Powered Timetable Management & Attendance

EduSched is a modern, full-stack web application designed to streamline the complex process of school timetable generation and attendance tracking. It leverages the power of Generative AI to create conflict-free schedules and provides a seamless QR code-based system for marking student attendance.

The application is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a Next.js frontend, Firebase for user authentication, and Supabase for the database backend.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **AI-Powered Timetable Generation**: Admins can input courses, teachers, classrooms, time slots, and student groups, and the AI will generate an optimized, conflict-free timetable.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**:
    *   **Admin**: Full control over the system, including data management, user creation, and timetable generation.
    *   **Teacher**: Can view timetables, scan student QR codes to take attendance, and download attendance lists.
    *   **Student**: Can view their timetable and generate daily QR codes for each subject to mark their attendance.
*   **Secure User Authentication**: User login and registration are handled securely through **Firebase Authentication**.
*   **Robust Database Backend**: All application data, including user profiles, timetables, and attendance records, is stored and managed in a **Supabase** PostgreSQL database.
*   **Dynamic QR Code System**:
    *   Students generate a unique, time-sensitive QR code for each class.
    *   Teachers and Admins use the built-in scanner to instantly record attendance.
    *   Attendance records are saved directly to the database.
*   **Downloadable Attendance Reports**: Teachers can download a simple text file of attendees for any given session.
*   **Interactive Timetable View**: A clean, table-based view of the generated schedule that is easy to read and use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v20 or later)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase project
*   A Supabase project

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase and Supabase credentials. This file is ignored by Git.

    ```env
    # Firebase Client Credentials (for client-side SDK)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

    # Supabase Credentials
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

    # Firebase Admin Credentials (for server-side actions like user creation)
    # Ensure the private key is correctly formatted with newlines (\n)
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
    ```

4.  **Set up the Supabase Database:**
    *   In your Supabase project's SQL Editor, run the queries from `src/lib/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables (`users`, `attendance`).
    *   Make sure you have an `admin` user in your `users` table to be able to log in and use the admin features. You can add one manually in the Supabase table editor.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):**
    ```sh
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This is required for the AI timetable generation feature to work.
